#summary Tweaking Map Styles (imposm branch)

= Introduction =

This page contains information about the way to tweak map styles using the imposm branch of the mapserver-utils project.

= Generating a mapfile =

The mapfile called osm-_STYLE_.map is generated by executing the 'make' command based on the settings at the top of the Makefile.

= Makefile =

The following parameters are configurable at the top of the Makefile:

 * *OSM_PREFIX*: the prefix of the table names in the postgis database
 * *OSM_SRID*: EPSG code of the mapfile's output projection (common values are 4326 for lon,lat and 900913 for the Google Mercator projection)
 * *OSM_UNITS*: MapServer units corresponding to the OSM_SRID
 * *OSM_EXTENT*: Default extents to use in the generated mapfile (in the same coordinate system as OSM_SRID)
 * *STYLE*: Name of the map style to generate. Three styles are available to choose from by default: default, google and bing

= generate_style.py script =

The generate_style.py script contains the value of all configurable style parameters.

At the top of the file, the _vars_ array defines the default values of all configurable parameters. Those values are used by the _default_ style.

Then the _style_ array that follows can be used to define custom styles. A custom style inherits the settings of the default style (from the vars array), and then all values set for that style in the _styles_ array override default values. Two sample custom styles are provided as examples: the google and bing styles.
